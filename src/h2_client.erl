%% this is gonna get weird. start_link/* is going to call
%% http2_socket's start_link function, which will handle opening the
%% socket and sending the HTTP/2 Preface over the wire. Once that's
%% working, it's going to call gen_statem:start_link(http2c, [SocketPid],
%% []) which will then use our init/1 callback. You can't actually
%% start this gen_statem with this API. That's intentional, it will
%% eventually get started if things go right. If they don't, you
%% wouldn't want one of these anyway.
